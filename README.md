# Kogan Coding Challenge
## Setup Instructions
Language: `Python3.6`
In the root directory of the project run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
I recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your
existing Python distributions.

## How to Run Program
Run the program with:
```
python3 main.py
```
You should see an output of the following format, which is rounded to
4 decimal places:
```
The average weight of all the air conditioners is 41.6134kg
```
